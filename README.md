# BeeHappy
BeeHappy is a student project for the Ambient Intelligence course held at Politecnico di Torino. It is focused around a smart hive which can be remotely monitored and controlled.

Our aim is to provide an easy way for the beekeeper to automate some basic tasks of its daily routine. We believe that helping the beekeeper could result in significant benefits for the bees and the environment.

# What does it do?
BeeHappy is capable of:

1. Monitoring the temperature and the humidity of the hive
2. Automatically feeding the bees and schedule the feeding days remotely
3. Interactively release smoke to calm the bees when the beekeeper is in loco
4. Detect swarms and monitor them with a camera [WIP]

# How does it do that?
The BeeHappy system is based around a Raspberry Pi connected to the Internet, various sensors and actuators and an Android app [Android 5.0 or higher]. The system is lightweight, easy to install and cheap on electricity. It could be powered by external batteries, 5V input (when avaiable) or even solar panels.

# What is the current state of development?
Work In Progress. We are currently putting the system together for the first time, and we are conscious that we need a lot of testing to get it working.
